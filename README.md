# CyPhER

Installing and updating can be done with the install script cypher-install-script.sh.  Make sure to make it executable first with "chmod u+x ./cypher-install-script.sh" so it can be run.  It will take a while to compile GraphBLAS but the rest goes quick.  After the script is run the dependecies will have been pulled from GitHub into the user's home directory and installed to PATH.
